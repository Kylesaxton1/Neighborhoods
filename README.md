Abstract (brief summary of metrics):

We used three different metrics, the first of which is the median death age. For that we looked at the neighborhood with the highest median death age and chose that one as the winner. Second, we looked at all of the crime of the neighborhoods and the amount of crime per capita. For this one we also looked at all of the violent crime and added an extra bonus of one point for violent crimes and we chose the neighborhood with the lowest crime rate per capita. Finally, we looked at the playground data. We looked at all of the data for all of the equipment in each of the neighborhoods in pittsburgh and assigned one point for the equipment simply existing. We also assigned another point for the playground equipment also being ADA accessible. After analyzing all of the data, we decided that Squirrel Hill South was the best neighborhood in pittsburgh because it took the place of number one in both the playground data and the median death age and was only number 6 in crime rate.

Winner: Squrrel Hill South
